# Drug-OverDose-Prediction

This month, May is all about mental health awareness and this project was very meaningful for us to pursue for this hackathon. 


Goals : 
1) Application to identify risk of drug overdose using predictive modeling
2) 

Who can use this?

Government Official -  I want access to accurate predictions of future drug overdose death rates to inform policy decisions and resource allocation
Healthcare Provider - I need a tool that can help me identify patients who are at high risk of drug overdose so that I can offer targeted interventions and support
Researcher - I require robust data analytics capabilities to study trends in drug overdose deaths across different demographic groups and geographic regions

### **User Experience**

1. **Personalized Predictions** User uploads CSV files containing keyword performance data
(future enhacement - **Data Input:** User inputs CSV file and gets predicted output based on this)
2. **Analysis:** The tool is trained on the historical dataset provided to run and regression and predict the risk of drug overdose
3. **Recommendations:**
