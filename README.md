Who can use this?

Government Official -  I want access to accurate predictions of future drug overdose death rates to inform policy decisions and resource allocation

Healthcare Provider - I need a tool that can help me identify patients who are at high risk of drug overdose so that I can offer targeted interventions and support

Researcher - I require robust data analytics capabilities to study trends in drug overdose deaths across different demographic groups and geographic regions
